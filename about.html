   <p>
     Scheme is a schedule creator designed for students, employees, and everyone in between. Due to the pandemic more and more people have shifted to attending school and work online from home. This means there's a higher number of zoom and google meetings to keep track of, all with varying days and times. Scheme offers a way to easily organize these appointments so that you are always on time!
